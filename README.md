# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## FreeCodeCamp credit

This app was created by following the tutorial found here:

This is my first time working with node.js and npm. The above tutorial is easy to follow.

To install nodejs and npm I simply downloaded the installer from:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Something to maybe watch out for when installing node and npm is getting the binaries added to the path.
The windows installer provides options to add to the system path, but I ended up having to add the nodejs
directory to the User path. The joys of windows development...
